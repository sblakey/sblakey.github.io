### Shaving

I prefer shaving with straight razors. I have a backlog of shave soaps I haven't tried yet, but bottles of shave oil would do well as gifts.
[King of Shaves](https://shave.com/collections/shaving-oils/products/sensitive-shave-oil-15ml) is the default in my travel bag,
but I enjoyed the [Sephora shave oil](https://www.sephora.com/product/maude-shave-moisturizing-shave-oil-P505732) as a treat,
and would be happy to try others.
