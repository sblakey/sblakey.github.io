## Gift Donations

## Books

Most of the good options are on my [Amazon Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/37CH4D5SGWUH2/)

## Shaving Stuff

I prefer shaving with straight razors. I have a backlog of shave soaps I haven't tried yet, but bottles of shave oil do pretty well.
[King of Shaves](https://shave.com/collections/shaving-oils/products/sensitive-shave-oil-15ml) is the default in my travel bag,
but I enjoyed the [Sephora shave oil](https://www.sephora.com/product/maude-shave-moisturizing-shave-oil-P505732) as a treat,
and would be happy to try others.

## Knitting Stuff

I have a lot of notions tagged on Etsy, which I need to list over here.
